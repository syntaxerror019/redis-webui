## Overview

Redis WebUI is a lightweight, open-source web interface to **inspect, monitor, and interact with Redis databases**. Itâ€™s designed for convenience, security, and usability:

- Modern Bootstrap 5 design
- Responsive cards, tables, and progress bars
- Key pagination for large databases
- Session-based credential storage (never persisted to disk)
- CPU, memory, uptime, and command stats at a glance

Perfect for **local development** or securely connecting to remote Redis servers.
